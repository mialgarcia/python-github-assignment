# Study Time Calculator

This project is a simple Python program that asks the user how many hours they studied today, then calculates an estimate of weekly study hours. It includes basic error handling to prevent crashes if the user enters invalid input. The project was created to practice using VS Code, Git, and GitHub.

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```
python app.py
```

## Example Output

```
Welcome to my Python program!
How many hours did you study today? 2
You are on track to study 14 hours this week.
```
